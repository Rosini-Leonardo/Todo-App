> This is a full-stack application built to showcase my skills in programming fully dynamic web applications.

## How was it made?
It was created with the help of various technologies derived from the programming languages that I use most (python and javascript).
Front-end:
        -To create the front-end I mainly used Bootstrap and the React library, but also many others such as: styled-components, react-router-dom, etc ...

Back-end:
        -Instead for the back-end server side I used Django and SQLite.
